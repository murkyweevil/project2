1. To get the bot token or API key you need to first go to discord.com/developers/applications from there you click
on your bot and select bot. Then you click reveal TOKEN.
2.The bot token goes in the .env file example DISCORD_TOKEN{your_bot_Token}
3. You need the discord.py package and the python-dotenv package, also requires python 3
4. The changes I made included outputted text that read "This is all for a school project!" when a user types in 
"why though".
5. "why though"
6. "This is all for a school project!"
7. If the computer that hosts this bot stays on all the time, then I would keep a background process of this always 
running. If the computer turns off, then I would have it running on a separate machine. Such as an aws instance.
